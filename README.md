RECOM.NETWORK has its origin in yearn.finance. 
The project provides for increased profitability, lending, work on the basis of keep3r.network, focused on the safety of client funds, under the protection of a cover protocol. An example of lending looks like this.
Sarah contributes to the recom.network loan pool.
Adam wants to take out a loan, and pays collateral to the platform, while Sara herself decides to give Adam a loan or not. Sarah can also hire a loan officer through keep3r.network. The specialist wants to find a job through keep3r.network and if he wants to manage Sara’s assets, then he must provide security for Sara to avoid losing Sara’s assets. If the specialist issued a loan with Sara’s assets, and the loan was not repaid on time and the specialist does not contact Sara, then the collateral from the borrower and the specialist is transferred to Sarah and Sara can further dispose of the assets at her discretion. The project is under development. Development stage is 75% complete. Dapp is coming soon at recom.network.
